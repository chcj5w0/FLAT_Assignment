# FLAT_Assignment
## Formal Languages and Automata Theory Programming Assignment  
(Seoul National University of Science and Technology)  
The assignment is implementing a simple program to simluate DFAs, NPDAs, and Turing machines in Python.  

 

What you have to do is completing the code, so that the program can pass all the test cases.  

There are open test cases as well as secret test cases which I'll use to verify your code.  

The scores will be given based on the number of test cases your program passes.  

You can assume that all conditions we discussed for DFAs, NPDAs, and Turing machines will hold for test cases, hence exception handling for those cases is unnecessary.  

 

## Here is some instruction.

Download "flat_assignment.zip" and unzip the file.
There are several .py files you can use.
"dfa.py"/"npda.py"/"turing_machine.py" files have basic skeleton code.
"dfa_test.py"/"npda_test.py"/"turing_machine_test.py" have test cases. You can execute these files to get the results of open test cases.  
There is a directory "automata" with files like "dfa1.txt" or "npda1.txt", which include information of automata used for test cases.  
Once it's done, you need to submit your "dfa.py"/"npda.py"/"turing_machine.py" files only. You must not submit any other files except for these three files.  
**Remember that you must not change the file names. Also, don't put it into a diretory or compress the files into one.**  
Just upload the three .py files with the completed code plainly.  
**You may lose the points if you cannot keep the submission requirements.**  

제출시 dfa.py, npda.py, turing_machine.py 세 파일을 업로드하여 제출하고, 절대 압축하거나 파일명을 변경하지 마세요.  
제출형식을 지키지 못해 문제가 생길 경우 점수를 부여받지 못할 수 있습니다.  
* DFA와 NPDA, Turing machine에 대해 강의시간에 다룬 가정들이 모두 테스트에서도 성립한다고 가정해도 무방합니다.  
따라서 이런 경우 - empty string이 Turing machine에 입력으로 주어지는 경우 - 등에 대해서는 예외처리를 하지 않아도 됩니다.
